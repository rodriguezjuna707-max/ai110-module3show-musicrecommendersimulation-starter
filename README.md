# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

This system scores every song in the catalog based on a user's preferences for genre, mood, energy, valence, danceability, and acousticness. Genre and mood are the most important because they show what a listener truly wants at any moment. Numeric features are scored by how close they are to the target rather than just by loudness or speed. A song that matches your desired energy ranks higher than one that is only louder or faster. Each recommendation comes with a clear explanation so you can understand why a song was selected.

- Each `Song` uses: `genre`, `mood`, `energy`, `valence`, `danceability`, `acousticness`
- The `UserProfile` stores: a preferred genre, mood, and target value for each numeric feature
- Scores are computed as a weighted proximity sum, normalized to a 0.0–1.0 scale
- All 18 songs are scored and sorted; the top k are returned with explanations

---

### Algorithm Recipe

**Step 1 — Load the Catalog**
Read every row from `songs.csv` and cast numeric columns (`energy`, `valence`, `danceability`, `acousticness`, `tempo_bpm`) from strings to floats. All 18 songs enter the scoring pipeline.

**Step 2 — Score Each Song**
For every song, compute a normalized score in [0.0, 1.0] using this formula:

```
score = (
    0.30 × genre_match        +   # 1.0 if exact match, else 0.0
    0.30 × mood_match         +   # 1.0 if exact match, else 0.0
    0.20 × (1 − |song.energy       − user.energy|)       +
    0.12 × (1 − |song.valence      − user.valence|)      +
    0.05 × (1 − |song.danceability − user.danceability|) +
    0.03 × (1 − |song.acousticness − user.acousticness|)
)
```

Weight rationale:
- **Genre (0.30)** and **mood (0.30)** together carry 60% of the score. Genre is a hard stylistic boundary; mood is the user's emotional intent. They are weighted equally because mood cuts across genres — a chill user might enjoy lofi *or* ambient *or* jazz.
- **Energy (0.20)** is the most discriminating numeric feature in the catalog (range 0.28–0.97), so it gets the strongest numeric weight.
- **Valence (0.12)**, **danceability (0.05)**, and **acousticness (0.03)** handle fine-grained refinement once the top candidates are already surfaced.

**Step 3 — Generate an Explanation**
After scoring, the system checks which features drove the result:
- Exact genre or mood match → named explicitly
- Numeric similarity ≥ 0.85 → noted as "close to your target"
- No strong signal → falls back to "partial match across multiple features"

**Step 4 — Rank and Return Top K**
All 18 scored songs are sorted by score descending. The top `k` (default 5) are returned as `(song, score, explanation)` tuples. No song is excluded before scoring.

### Potential Biases

- **Genre over-prioritization:** Because genre and mood together account for 60% of the score, a song that perfectly matches genre and mood but has mismatched energy will still outrank a song with no genre match but a near-perfect numeric profile. A user who listens across genres could miss great discoveries.
- **Small catalog amplifies exact-match luck:** With 15 distinct genres across only 18 songs, most genres appear just once. If a user's favorite genre has no representative in the catalog, they score at most 0.70 — effectively penalized for an unusual taste, not a flaw in their preferences.
- **Mood labels are subjective:** "Chill" and "relaxed" feel similar to a human listener, but the binary match treats them as completely different. A jazz fan in a relaxed mood gets no mood credit for a chill lofi song, even though the vibe is close.
- **No listening history:** The system treats every user identically on the first run. It cannot learn that a specific user always skips high-energy songs despite listing `intense` as their favorite mood.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

   ```
2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this

---

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
